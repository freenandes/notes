## Serendipity notes

I’m not experienced with note-taking, I’m very chaotic and organized at the same time, but I think the act should be celebrated somehow.

Something in note-taking triggers a creative mindset, and the potential for discovery attracts me.

For a long time, I wanted to collect music again. I no longer possess physical records, and now I see a potential in markdown to do that. I miss stumbling upon what I’ve listened to, and I can’t find a vessel to hold all the new music I hear daily — this might be it.
