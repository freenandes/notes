I will try this popular idea among comic artists of sketching what happened today or yesterday. A sort of “diary”. It just started to populate my Youtube. I know it won’t be a daily register for my case, that’s for sure. Too many things are happening, and I don’t have the discipline for that. So, I will start slowly with this last Sunday.

I'm hoping to get some focus time and some peace. To take the pencil for a stroll and let my brain offload. I also want to replace doomscrolling with this and ensure my brain is cleaner for longer art sessions… For which I also don’t have time, but… Well, let’s see about that.

Loved doing this one. The process accomplished my goals. It was fun and therapeutic, but I don’t like the output. Too dirty and clumsy for my taste. I guess I have to let it be and try again.
