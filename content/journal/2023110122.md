My daughter started walking today. It was emotional for me. I was thrilled to see the joy of that accomplishment in her face. She giggled and screamed while stomping.

I got that she felt the rush of taking a risky decision, and was riding on adrenaline. She already knew the mechanics of walking, but was afraid of falling, like she did so many times, so she would hold any furniture she could. But today she let herself go and walked about 30 meters straight.

This is what happens when we take risks and just let ourselves go. The fall is guaranteed, but you will only evolve if you give it a try, or multiple tries until you get it. Basic, cheesy, couldâ€™ve been a Bluey catchphrase, but a good lesson nonetheless.
