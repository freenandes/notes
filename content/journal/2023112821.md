Where does the fear of the dark come from?

I wonder why my daughter, until now, has never gotten afraid of venturing into pitch-black rooms. She continues as if not seeing is not a problem to enjoying the space.

This fascinates me, and apparently no one is born with that fear (according to a light research I did now). It is probably something that we acquire through popular experience. Stories we tell, things we hear but don't see well at night, fear of the unknown.

A baby doesn't know now, but will at some point. I wonder if this could hold the potential of crafting a narrative that empowers people to beat their fears.
