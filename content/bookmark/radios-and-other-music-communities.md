These are some of my favorite radios:

- [Cashmere radio](https://cashmereradio.com/) — Cool music and I like the amateurish or uncompromised vibe. It’s cool and has great music for me. Sometimes german speaking gets in the way because I don’t understand any.
- [LYL radio ](http://www.lyl.live/) — Clean emissions, meaning minimal chatter and very enjoyable music shows that align perfectly with my tastes. A lot of experimental and easy-listening.
- [NTS radio](https://www.nts.live/) — Classic love of mine. A bit too talkative for my taste in some shows, but the people they invite to host align very well with my musical tastes.
