## Radios

These are some of my favorite radios:

- [Cashmere radio](https://cashmereradio.com/) — Cool music and I like the amateurish or uncompromised vibe. It’s cool and has great music for me. Sometimes german speaking gets in the way because I don’t understand any.
- [LYL radio ](http://www.lyl.live/) — Clean emissions, meaning minimal chatter and very enjoyable music shows that align perfectly with my tastes. A lot of experimental and easy-listening.
- [NTS radio](https://www.nts.live/) — Classic love of mine. A bit too talkative for my taste in some shows, but the people they invite to host align very well with my musical tastes.

## Shows

The radio shows I often come back to:

- [Perfect Sound Forever](https://www.nts.live/shows/perfect-sound-forever) — Ambient, dream-pop and shoegaze have a special place in my heart and this shows collects the stuff I’m usually into and helps me discover some new old records.
