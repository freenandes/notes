I like the aesthetic a lot. The creator has great taste, in my view. But I guess that is not enough of a reason to use the app.

From the functional standpoint, I didn’t like using it as it was not smooth enough, like, for example, Obsidian Canvas is.

I do like however it’s integration with Are.na, and I want to explore that. I also like that I can easily export JSON, even though I don’t have a plan on how to use these files out of these types of tools…
