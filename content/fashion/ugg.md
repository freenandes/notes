I got attracted to UGG’s idea of supporting a fair labor scheme, but the reality is I cannot be sure, just hold to their claims… They don’t have any proof, and I just wish they could be more transparent about it.

I do, however, like the use of repurposed materials in some products.

## Scuff Deco slippers

Positives:
- Very comfortable.
- Apparently durable, looking at the sturdiness and construction quality.
- Organic materials that are also repurposed.

Negatives:
- Slightly short in length.

I hope to make these materials last a long time and that I can get this easily repaired by a local cobbler if needed.

## Tasman LTA slippers

Positives:
- Robust construction with straight seams.
- Cool design for indoors and perfect for home office use without the feeling of wearing slippers.
- Recycled polyester.
- Organic materials (besides the polyester), including the sugarcane waste usage for the outer sole.
- Warm to use.

Negatives:
- There’s not much chance of repairability with the polyester outer.
- Not 100% comfortable with first uses.
