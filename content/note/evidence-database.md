## Problem

From experience, I’m finding that, plenty of times, the issue with problem-solving, and how the “design world” absorbed that concept (probably will write more on this later), is that there is lack of proper communication of why we shaped a given solution.

I feel like we can almost assume that all issues arise, and blockers to innovation appear, out of inadequate communication of the problems we are solving and improper convincing on how betting on the solution at hands is, in fact, targeted to real issues and problems the business needs to suppress.

Businesses wrapped in capitalism are naturally anxious and constantly debating on the risks and can’t see any connection to solution proposals. The result of that is often inaction, while competitors take the plunge and win, leaving the rest of the market far behind. I guess that is a natural outcome of capitalism, one strives while others sink.

## Solution

One glimpse I had recently is that my focus on a simplified communication system of evidence does seem to be fruitful.

When presenting evidence from a user research case, I force with all my strength to only present the crux of what anyone needs to know to move forward to contemplating the recommendations or the solution.

Now, I apply strength because it is not easy. Digesting and synthesizing information from interviews takes time and effort. Especially if you are analyzing video interviews… However, “AI” came quickly to the rescue this year. It’s at a level now that you can put AI to synthesize the information for you very fast with minimal hallucination, only requiring thorough review and near zero manual writing.

Simple, short sentences that frame problems work. On the other hand, simple framings of recommendations also work. Meaning, simple, short sentences is something anyone can read fast and print on the back of the minds.

So, yes, long form text is so dumb and so
