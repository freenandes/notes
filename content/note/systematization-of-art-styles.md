I found this video interesting and eye-opening, mainly because I’m a bit numb nowadays about these theories, or I’m not thinking as much as I’d like. Also, I love systematization and cataloging, so I simply glued to the screen, waiting for it to unfold and explain.

Here’s the [video by Ryan Nein, “Systematizing Art Styles”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4Jf_vE6Fo). Here are some interesting shots and thoughts for later. 

It builds on [Scott McCloud’s “triangle”](http://www.scottmccloud.com/4-inventions/triangle/) but expands it by touching on its flaws or limitations to frame some art pieces. Below is a re-mapping of Scott’s triangle examples into Ryan’s diamond.

I like how Ryan’s perspicacity transforms the triangle into a diamond by splitting symbolism and abstraction by analyzing some works of art and clarifying Objectivity and Subjectivity in this context.

Although i found the analysis slightly biased 

I found some flaws, especially when Ryan tries to expand the diamond-like square diagram into an square again.
