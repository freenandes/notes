The essentials:
1. Layout optimized for water use.
2. Soil that retains just enough moisture, without drying or soaking.
3. Drought-tolerant plants.
4. Efficient irrigation.
5. Application of mulch to maximize water retention.
6. Pruning and weeding.

### Layout

- Group plants with similar water needs.
- Consider the sunlight and shade each plant will get.
- Slopes and contours for efficient water runoff.
- Use permeable materials like gravel on pathways to allow water absorption.
- Keep plant sizes in check to prevent overgrowth and increased water use.

### Soil

- Know and test the soil compatibility.
- Improve water retention with organic matter.
- Loosen any compacted soil to improve water infiltration.

### Plants

- Prefer native.
- Pick the ones that require less water.
- Consider long roots.
- A good pick may be the ones that bloom during the wettest seasons.
